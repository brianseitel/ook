Over 100 autonomous vehicles from a dozen manufacturers are now being tested in public, covering hundreds of thousands of kilometres each year. </p><p>But this car is different: its human driver keeps his hands firmly on the wheel.

But what if, instead of bringing the boosters back to Earth, you could build one that never leaves it? Your propulsion system could be arbitrarily large and powerful, since you wouldn’t have to lift it; your spacecraft, no longer needing engines or fuel, could be stripped down to its barest essentials.</p><p>Such a split sounds impractical, but beams of light could make it work. One of the counterintuitive implications of the theory of relativity is that, although light has no mass, it still has momentum. Thus when light bounces off a mirror it exerts a tiny pressure; if the light is bright enough, and the mirror light enough, the mirror will start moving.</p><p></p><p>In the 1970s Robert Forward, a physicist, showed that very powerful lasers could push a spacecraft with a reflecting “sail” to a tenth the speed of light or more. Moving thousands of times faster than rockets can, such probes might reach planets round other stars in decades, rather than in...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21696876-interstellar-travel-means-thinking-both-very-big-and-very-small-new-plan?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

Now an extensive study of the genetics of more than 500,000 people has revealed a different kind of mutant superhero: a small number of individuals who seem to be perfectly healthy despite carrying in their DNA a mutation linked to a severe childhood disorder.</p><p>The 13 adults identified were found to have faulty genes associated with one of eight different inherited conditions. These included cystic fibrosis, a disease that interferes with breathing, and atelosteogenesis, which affects bone and limb development.

Collisions with birds are reckoned to cost America’s airlines almost $1 billion in repairs and flight delays annually. When a multiple bird-strike knocked out both engines of a US Airways Airbus A320 taking off from LaGuardia Airport, New York, in 2009 all 155 passengers and crew survived only after the pilots carefully glided the aircraft to a splashdown on the Hudson River. Airports have tried all sorts of ways to shoo away birds but few work for any length of time. Now an ornithologist has come up with a bird scarer that might be the answer.</p><p>John Swaddle and his colleagues at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, think the trick is to blanket the area around a runway with a noise that makes it difficult for birds to communicate. Sound is already used to scare off birds: examples include the boom of propane cannons and recordings of predatory hawks. But birds soon get used to such ruses.</p><p></p><p>Dr Swaddle knew that noise from traffic and machinery at a certain frequency could disturb birds. To explore this, the researchers decided to investigate...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21696922-new-way-shoo-birds-away-airports-sonic-scarecrow?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

On April 8th SpaceX, an American rocketry firm founded by Elon Musk, completed one of its resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS). The journey is now a routine operation: the eighth such mission the company has flown, although one failed to reach orbit. This launch, though, was more interesting than most, for two reasons.</p><p>One was that the Falcon 9 rocket was carrying a nifty new inflatable module designed to attach to the ISS (<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21696487-international-space-station-about-get-inflatable-extension-pump-it">see article</a>). The second was that, following four previous failures, SpaceX at last managed to recover the first stage of its rocket by landing it on a platform on a drone ship stationed in the Atlantic.<br> <br>It was a spectacular manoeuvre, with the rocket’s first stage detaching itself as the second stage carried on into orbit. It required the first stage to flip itself around and re-light its engines to slow itself down. Using a mixture of rocket power and its fins, the first stage guided itself back through the atmosphere to land upright...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21696682-spectacular-manoeuvre-falcon-9-rocket-spacex-makes-historic-sea?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

And it is growing: its 15 existing modules are due to be joined by five more before the decade is out. On April 8th, if all goes according to plan, a rocket will lift off from Cape Canaveral in Florida carrying the first of these new additions. But it is no ordinary module.</p><p>The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM—illustrated above) is the first bit of the ISS created entirely at the initiative of a private company. Bigelow Aerospace, its manufacturer, is an American space firm set up in 1999 by Robert Bigelow, a businessman who made his money in the hotel trade. And unlike the rest of the ISS, which is essentially a series of space-going aluminium cans, the BEAM is made from cloth. It is folded up and stowed for the journey into orbit, much like a tent, and then inflated to its full size after being attached to the station.</p><p></p><p>An inflatable space station might sound a bit mad (perhaps for that reason, Bigelow Aerospace prefers the word “expandable”). But many space cadets are fans of the idea.

Coral thrives in warm water but quickly dies if temperatures rise just a single degree above the average summer maximum for their region. As climate change warms the world’s oceans this is a precarious situation. But not all corals suffer at the same temperatures. While most perish in water above 31°C, those in the Persian Gulf can withstand a punishing 35°C. Now a new study suggests that the way these corals survive could help corals elsewhere adapt to changing conditions.</p><p>Corals get their brilliant colours from tiny algae that live in their tissue in a symbiotic relationship—the coral provides a home and the algae food produced during photosynthesis. If it gets too hot the algae leave, turning coral into a “bleached” white skeleton. Last year, Jörg Wiedenmann, a marine biologist, and his colleagues at the University of Southampton in Britain discovered that the algae inside the Persian Gulf corals were in fact a different species from that commonly found in other parts of the world. It was this species’ ability to tolerate extreme heat...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21696486-newly-found-species-algae-might-help-corals-survive-warm-water-hot?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

The bombs used in Belgium might well have been picked up after the check-in desks at Zaventem Airport, but the suicide-attackers probably never intended to reach the security gate. The intensive screening carried out inside airports is not practical in many other places. That could change as new techniques are developed.</p><p>The bombs in Brussels were composed of triacetone triperoxide, known as TATP. This is the same explosive used to kill 52 people in London in train and bus attacks in 2005. It is extremely unstable, but for terrorists bent on sacrificing themselves TATP has considerable appeal since it can be made from compounds found in easily obtained materials such as paint thinners and hair-bleaching agents.</p><p></p><p>TATP can be detected with traditional technologies, like ion mobility spectrometry.

Fitting ships with sails to assist with propulsion, thus saving fuel and reducing emissions, is an idea that has been around for decades. It has now gained renewed interest with a search by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI), a British public–private partnership that promotes low-carbon uses, for suppliers and a shipowner prepared to undertake a trial of wind-driven rotors on a large cargo vessel. The plan is to gather operating data on whether rotor sails are a worthwhile investment. Depending on the routes, suitably equipped vessels could reduce fuel consumption by 5-12%. As some 90% of the world’s trade travels by sea, such savings would soon add up.</p><p>The type of sail the ETI is interested in is the Flettner rotor. These were demonstrated by Anton Flettner, a German aerospace engineer, in the 1920s. When placed on a ship the giant rotating cylinders extract energy from the wind using the Magnus effect, a force acting on a spinning body in an airstream to create a pressure...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21696488-wind-power-makes-another-comeback-we-are-sailing?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>
